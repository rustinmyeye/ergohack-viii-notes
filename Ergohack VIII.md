## analog-ergo
- 6

I'm happy to see analog-ergo back again for this year's Ergohack. This project is strongly aligned with the theme of integrating Bitcoin, as it is focused on integrating Lightning Network â†” Ergo swaps. Love to see the progress, and its very exciting to see that a test swap has been successful!

## crystal-pool

Fantastic presentation of a very exciting new trading platform. This is exactly what I feel Ergo needs more of; impressive replacements for centralized garbage, that really takes advantage of Ergo's unique feature set. The design is familiar and clean, with what looks like a great user experience for L1 trades (instant ui updates, integrated wallet, multisig smart contracts). I can see the alignment to the Bitcoin theme, in that Bitcoin users may want to bridge to Ergo in order to advantage of this trading platform. Taking a look at the GitHub, I wasn't able to run the web ui (user error on my part), but the code looks professional and I'm happy to see that development has continued, even after the Ergohack deadline has passed. 

## duckpools

Duckpools is a major player in the Ergo defi ecosystem, and I am always so impressed with how innovative they are and how they are always improving their platform. The option pools for Duckpools is another solid financial tool, that will bring much more attention to Defi within Ergo's ecosystem. Creating a pool to peer options platform in the time provided is quite impressive.

## moria-finance

Moria Finance has presented a finance managing platform, currently consisting of a multisig wallet in an easy to use web ui. This will be a great addition to the Ergo ecosystem as it brings another option for multisig, but with greater ease of use and professional design. It will be nice to see if they can incorporate the timelock contracts, as this will be a great feature under this simple to use platform.

## rosen-port
- 5

Rosen Port is such a great idea, and I feel it will improve the user experience of the Rosen Bridge immensly. By making the bridge fee less of a burden for small transactions it should, in my mind, increase the accessibility of bridging to Ergo for everyone. I am excited to see this project continue development in the future!

## rng-dev
- 3

This project is very well presented, and I believe it will be a great tool for Ergo developers looking for RNG for their decentralized apps. I appreciate the effort put into giving examples, with a server available to test them. The code looks professional, and appears to still be under active development. I don't see much of a connection to the theme of integrating Bitcoin, however I don't doubt that this could be helpful in some way regarding the theme. 

## wallet-wonderland
- 8

Wallet Wonderland was an impressive effort to understand the user sentiment towards the wallets of Ergo. The survey and analasis of the collected data can be useful to wallet developers, however I only see a loose connection to the theme of integrating Bitcoin. 

## mining-btc-swap
- 7

qx() and Marc have created the start of something great for Ergo mining. I love to see the miners get new tools to make their mining buisness more sucessful, as well as incentivise them to remain within the Ergo ecosystem. The automatic payments in other native tokens or wrapped assets is reminicsent of Guapswap, but with the simplicity of Getblok (RIP). I am also very excited to see the integration with Duckpools. This project aligns with the theme of integrating Bitcoin, as one of the main supported assets is palnned to be rsBTC.
